# E-Nose-Project
System Design document for E-Nose project

Now-a-days, pollution has become a major concern. Many life-threatening diseases are
caused by pollution. People face many problems because of the air inhaled which causes
serious illness. The air which may seem clean might be polluted because of the blend of
poisonous gases contained in it. It is difficult to detect them by human sense. So, we need
the technological support for detection and indication of quality of air. The E-Nose can be
used to detect such gases and odors. The proposed work is to develop a prototype which senses the air through the sensors and then
classifies it based on its quality. The classification is done using “Pattern Recognition System”
which involves Classification Algorithms of Machine Learning. E-Nose is considered to be a
potential way to balance the trade-off between cost and accuracy.
